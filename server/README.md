Sure, here's a basic documentation for your project:

# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project is a simple Express server that connects to a MongoDB database.
It provides several endpoints for: 
user management, including registration, login, and user data retrieval and update.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies: Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. Set up environment variables: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   - `MONGO_URI`: The connection string for your MongoDB database.

## Running the Server

To start the server, run `npm run start:server` in the terminal. The server will start on port 3001.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Returns default "Hello World!" message.
- `GET /gendered-users`: Returns all users with the specified gender.
- `POST /register`: Registers a new user. The request body should include `email` and `password`.
- `POST /login`: Logs in a user. The request body should include `email` and `password`.
- `PUT /user`: Updates user data. The request body should include the user data to update.
- `GET /user`: Returns the data for the user with the specified user ID.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during a database operation, the server will log the error
and return a 500 status code with a "Something went wrong" message.
If a user tries to register with an email that's already in use, or tries to log in with incorrect credentials,
the server will return a 400 status code with an appropriate message.
